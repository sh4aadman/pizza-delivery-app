Pizza Delivery WebApp

Built with React, Node, Express and MongoDB

A customer can see details of different pizzas with a beautiful animation with a slider. Then he/she can choose a pizza with preferences like: base, sauce, cheese type and veggies-or-not. Then he/she can proceed to checkout. Admin have access to all other information along with remaining stock of ingredients. An warning notification will be sent towards Admin if it reaches below threshold. And also Admin can change the delivery status of the ongoing orders of pizzas. Any change made by Admin will reflect in user's UI.

But, first of all, you have to create an account or sign in to use these features.
